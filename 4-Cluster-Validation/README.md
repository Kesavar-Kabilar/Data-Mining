## Clustering Validation with Jaccard Similarity and NMI - README.md

### Problem Description

This project focuses on evaluating the quality of clustering results by implementing two key metrics:

* **Jaccard Similarity:** Measures the similarity between two sets (clusters in this case) by considering the ratio of elements shared by both sets to the total number of elements in the union of those sets. 
* **Normalized Mutual Information (NMI):** Quantifies the mutual information between the true cluster labels and the predicted cluster labels, normalized by the maximum achievable mutual information.

To facilitate these calculations, we'll first implement the confusion matrix. 

### Confusion Matrix

* A confusion matrix is a table that visualizes the performance of an algorithm by comparing the true labels of data points with their predicted labels.
* Each cell (i, j) in the matrix represents the number of data points whose true label was i but were predicted to belong to cluster j.

### Jaccard Similarity

**Formula:**

```
J(A, B) = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|
```

* **J(A, B):** Jaccard similarity between sets A and B.
* **|A ∩ B|:** Number of elements in the intersection of sets A and B (elements belonging to both clusters).
* **|A ∪ B|:** Number of elements in the union of sets A and B (elements belonging to either cluster or both).

**Interpretation:**

* A Jaccard similarity of 1 indicates perfect overlap between the two clusters (all elements are shared).
* A Jaccard similarity of 0 indicates no overlap between the clusters (no elements are shared).

### Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)

**Formula:**

```
NMI(X, Y) = 2 * I(X;Y) / (H(X) + H(Y))
```

* **NMI(X, Y):** Normalized Mutual Information between cluster assignments X and Y.
* **I(X;Y):** Mutual information between the two cluster assignments X and Y.
* **H(X):** Entropy of cluster assignment X.
* **H(Y):** Entropy of cluster assignment Y.

**Mutual Information (MI):**

```
I(X;Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y)
```

* **H(X,Y):** Joint entropy of X and Y.

**Entropy:**

```
H(X) = - Σ P(x) * log2(P(x))
```

* **P(x):** Probability of observing element x.

**Interpretation:**

* **NMI** ranges from 0 to 1.
- **NMI = 0:** No mutual information between the two clusterings, indicating they are completely different.
- **NMI = 1:** Perfect agreement between the two clusterings.

**Advantages of NMI:**

- **Normalization:** NMI is normalized, making it comparable across different datasets and clusterings with varying numbers of clusters.
- **Robustness:** It is less sensitive to the number of clusters than other metrics like purity.
- **Handles Overlapping Clusters:** NMI can handle overlapping clusters better than some other metrics.

By calculating NMI, we can evaluate the quality of a clustering algorithm by comparing its output to a ground truth or another clustering result.
